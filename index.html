        <h2> Obama Ipsum </h2>

            <p> I wanted to be part of something larger. It's that he spoke as if our society was static; as if no progress has been made; as if this country - a country that has made it possible for one of his own members to run for the highest office in the land and build a coalition of white and black; Latino and Asian, rich and poor, young and old - is still irrevocably bound to a tragic past. So let there be no doubt: the situation for the Palestinian people is intolerable.
        </p>
        <p> And that man is John Kerry. It is easy to point fingers - for Palestinians to point to the displacement brought by Israel's founding, and for Israelis to point to the constant hostility and attacks throughout its history from within its borders as well as beyond.
        </p> 
        <p> We cannot ignore that we have a right and a duty to protect our borders. Those stories - of survival, and freedom, and hope - became our story, my story; the blood that had spilled was our blood, the tears our tears; until this black church, on this bright day, seemed once more a vessel carrying the story of a people into future generations and into a larger world. They are full of dancing, clapping, screaming and shouting that may seem jarring to the untrained ear. It's that he spoke as if our society was static; as if no progress has been made; as if this country - a country that has made it possible for one of his own members to run for the highest office in the land and build a coalition of white and black; Latino and Asian, rich and poor, young and old - is still irrevocably bound to a tragic past. I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night.

        We worship an awesome God in the Blue States, and we don't like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the Red States. The audacity of hope! In the end, that is God's greatest gift to us, the bedrock of this nation. We also know that military power alone is not going to solve the problems in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Indeed, we can recall the words of Thomas Jefferson, who said: "I hope that our wisdom will grow with our power, and teach us that the less we use our power the greater it will be." I know that for many, the face of globalization is contradictory.
        </p>

        They are both passed away now. Now even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters, the negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes. But that same principle must apply to Muslim perceptions of America.
        </p>
        <p>
        Thank you, and God bless America.
