                      <p><strong> My name is Stephanie Perdomo. </strong> I was born in New York City but now proudly call New Jersey home. I’m currently pursuing a career in IT, working toward becoming an IT specialist. Technology has always interested me, and I’m excited to build a future in a field that’s constantly evolving and full of opportunity.

                Before stepping into the tech world, I spent several years working in business development and customer service roles within the automotive industry. Those experiences helped shape my strong communication skills and my passion for helping people—skills I plan to carry with me into my work in IT. I enjoy being part of environments that encourage growth, learning, and meaningful connections.

        <div class="hobby-container">
            <p>👗 🌻 🎨 When I’m not working or studying, I love spending time outdoors and exploring new places. Nature is my reset button—whether it’s taking a peaceful walk, enjoying a quiet picnic, or just being outside on a sunny day, it helps me feel centered and refreshed. I really enjoy visiting parks, gardens, and scenic spots where I can slow down and soak it all in.

                        I’m also a big fan of museums and cultural experiences. I love learning about history, art, and different perspectives—it’s always inspiring and makes me feel more connected to the world around me.
                        
                        And of course, beauty and fashion are my creative outlets. Whether I’m trying out a new makeup look or putting together an outfit, it’s something that brings me joy and lets me express who I am. Between nature, travel, and a bit of style, I try to keep life full of little moments that bring happiness and growth.

        <h2> Press-On Nails 2.0: Why They’re Back and Better Than Ever </h2>

        <div> 
            Press-on nails have had a major glow-up. Once considered a quick fix, they’re now a go-to beauty trend offering salon-quality looks without the price tag or time commitment. With reusable designs, long-lasting adhesives, and styles that rival pro nail techs, it's easy to see why they're blowing up online.

            <h2>Why Everyone's Obsessed</h2>
            <ul>
              
              <li><strong>Reusable:</strong> Many high-end sets can be worn 2–3 times.</li>
              <li><strong>Affordable:</strong> Save time and money compared to salon visits.</li>
              <li><strong>Style for Days:</strong> From minimalist to glam, there’s a press-on for you.</li>
              <li><strong>Easy to Apply:</strong> No skills needed, just press and go.</li>
                <p> 1. Prep Your Natural Nails
                    Start with clean, dry hands. Remove any old polish or oils from your nails using rubbing alcohol or a nail prep pad.
                    👉 Tip: This helps the glue/tabs stick better and last longer.</p>
                     
                     <p>2. Push Back Your Cuticles
                    Use a cuticle pusher to gently push back your cuticles. This gives you a cleaner surface and prevents lifting. </p> </li>
                    
                    
                    <p> 3. Buff and Shape
                    Lightly buff the surface of your natural nails to remove shine. Shape them with a file to match the press-ons, if needed. </p> </li>
                    
                     <p> 4. Find Your Sizes
                    Lay out all the press-on nails and match each one to your natural nail size. Most kits include extras for a custom fit.
                    👉 Pro tip: If you’re between sizes, go smaller — it sticks better and looks more natural. </p> </li>
                    
                     <p>5. Apply Adhesive </p>
                    <p> You’ve got two options: </p>
                    
                     <p> Nail glue: Apply a drop to your natural nail and the back of the press-on, then press together. </p>
                    
                        <p>Adhesive tabs: Peel and stick a tab to your nail, then press on the fake nail. </p>
                    
                        <p> 6. Press and Hold </li>
                   <p>Line up the press-on carefully, then press down firmly for at least 30 seconds. Apply even pressure to avoid bubbles or lifting. </p>
                    
                     <p>7. Finish Up
                        <p>Avoid water or heavy use of your hands for at least an hour after applying. This helps the bond set properly.</li></p>
            </ul>
