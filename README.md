## Overview

This personal website was created as part of my Web Page Development course to highlight my background, interests, and growing skill set in front-end design. It serves as a digital portfolio featuring a personal biography, my love for travel and nature, favorite hobbies, and curated photos that reflect who I am.

The websiteâ€™s layout combines vibrant colors with a clean, user-friendly interface to create an engaging experience. Throughout the development process, I utilized Visual Studio Code as my primary editor and applied essential web development skills, including HTML, CSS, responsive design principles, and image formatting. This project gave me the opportunity to express my creativity while demonstrating practical experience in building and styling a fully functional personal site.

## Visual Design
